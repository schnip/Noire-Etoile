Things that went well in our project
-Drawing things to the terminal went well, we managed to create a system to always get the terminal filled properly
-Making use of an interface allowed us to improve our workflow as a team
-Using stored procedures allowed us to check our data as we were putting it into the database to prevent duplicates

Things that did not go well
-Rolling an external jar into a project so that it can be run outside of eclipse proved extremely difficult, as such, we were never able to get the final version of our project to run in a normal terminal, as was the original plan
-Although we had a streamlined system for rendering each window, we did not have have a streamlined system for menus, which quickly became messy and unweildy, slowing down development speed and leading to many errors and problems
