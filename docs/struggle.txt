Things that went well in our project
-Drawing things to the terminal went well, we managed to create a system to always get the terminal filled properly
-Making use of an interface allowed us to improve our workflow as a team
-Using stored procedures allowed us to check our data as we were putting it into the database to prevent duplicates

Things that did not go well
-Rolling an external jar into a project so that it can be run outside of eclipse proved extremely difficult, as such, we were never able to get the final version of our project to run in a normal terminal, as was the original plan
-Although we had a streamlined system for rendering each window, we did not have have a streamlined system for menus, which quickly became messy and unweildy, slowing down development speed and leading to many errors and problems

Description of the front end
For the user interface of our game, we chose to use Java outputting to a terminal. We created an engine class that we could use to print to the screen the same way every single time, and an event class to keep consistnacy between events as well. This made use of an interface that was fufilled by a backend Java class that made all the JDBC calls for the project, providing the program will all its interaction to the MySQL database. The user was presented with the same input entry type every single time, which was a line at the bottom of the screen to type into, with the line being entered and the next screen being rendered upon the pressing of the enter key.
